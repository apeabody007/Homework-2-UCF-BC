    Aaron Peabody was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on August 28th, 1995. As a young child, he excelled at video games, puzzles, and sports. Being an only child, he often had to find ways to amuse himself. This would lead him to develop an interest in playing guitar. He received one for Christmas in 7th grade and has not put it down since.           </p>

    Forced to leave his homeland in 2000, Aaron moved to Florida with his parents, because he was still only five years old and they gave him food, water, and shelter. Upon leaving, Aaron vowed he would return to the great state of Wisconsin somehow or some way...          </p>

    Aaron grew up in Orlando and attended Bishop Moore Catholic High School. There he played soccer and excelled in his classes. So much so, that he was admitted into the University of Wisconsin, where he graduated with a BA in Economics in 2018.         </p>
